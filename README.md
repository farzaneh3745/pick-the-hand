# Pick the Hand 🎮

A simple Python terminal game where the user tries to guess which hand (left or right) the computer has chosen. Inspired by the traditional "Gol ya Pooch" game.

## 🎮 How to Play

- First, choose how many rounds you want to play.
- Then in each round, select:
  - `0` for left hand
  - `1` for right hand
- If your guess matches the computer’s hand, you win that round.

At the end, the game shows the total score and asks if you want to restart.

## ▶️ Run the Game

Make sure Python is installed.

Then run the script like this:

```bash
python pick_the_hand.py
